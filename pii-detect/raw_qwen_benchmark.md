| Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B (MPS) | sample-01 | easy | ssn | Onboarding form: Applicant Amanda Frost listed SSN 512-67-9087 for payroll setup. | True (Exact SSN format appears) | <think><br>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify the given content into the category "ssn" and provide the JSON response. The content provided is a note about an onboarding form where Amanda Frost listed her SSN as 512-67-9087.<br><br>First, I need to determine if this content contains U.S. sensitive information. The description mentions that SSSNs use the pattern AAA-GG-SSSS and uniquely identify taxpayers. The example given is Amanda Frost's SSN. Since the SSSN is a unique identifier for taxpayers, it's relevant. However, the content here is just a note about an onboarding form, not a direct request to identify a taxpayer. The note doesn't mention anything that would classify the SSN as private or sensitive.<br><br>The JSON should have "is_sensitive": false, because the content isn't about sensitive information. The confidence score would be 0.5 since it's a short note. The explanation should be a brief note explaining that the content is a note about an onboarding form with a valid SSN.<br><br>I need to make sure I'm not including any other information that might be considered sensitive. The example given uses a specific SSN, which is valid, but the classification here is based on the presence of the SSN pattern. Since there's no indication of privacy or misuse, the answer should be false.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": false, "confidence_score": 0.5, "explanation": "This content is a note about an onboarding form using a valid U.S. Social Security number (SSN) as part of a payroll setup. The SSN is a unique taxpayer identifier and does not contain sensitive information."} | ❌ |
| Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B (MPS) | sample-02 | easy | ssn | Inventory SKU SSN-5512-679-087 is discontinued; no personal identifiers logged. | False (String resembles SSN but context shows product code) | <think><br>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify the content into the "ssn" category. The description mentions that U.S. Social Security numbers use the AAA-GG-SSSS pattern and are unique for taxpayers. The content provided is about an inventory SKU SSN-5512-679-087 being discontinued and that no personal identifiers were logged.<br><br>Hmm, the classification here is about whether the content contains U.S. sensitive information. The original text is about a discontinued SKU with an SSN, which is a personal identifier. The user's instruction is to check if the content contains U.S. sensitive information for the category "ssn".<br><br>I need to determine if the content includes any U.S. personal identifiers. The example response shows that "is_sensitive" is true, confidence 0.5, and explanation is a short note. The content mentions an SSN in the SKU, which is a personal number. Since the category is "ssn", the content directly relates to that. The explanation mentions the pattern and uniqueness, which are related to the SSN structure, but the main point is the presence of the SSN in the inventory entry.<br><br>I should confirm that the content includes the SSN, which it does, and that it's relevant to the category. Therefore, the classification should be "is_sensitive": true, confidence 0.5, and the explanation is a short note about the SSN in the inventory.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": true, "confidence_score": 0.5, "explanation": "The content contains a U.S. Social Security Number (SSN) in the inventory SKU, which is a sensitive personal identifier related to the 'ssn' category."} | ❌ |
| Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B (MPS) | sample-03 | easy | email | Customer left feedback: reach me at celine.ortega@orbis.org if questions. | True (Valid email present) | <think><br>Okay, let me start by looking at the content provided. The user wants me to classify the given email content into the specified category and provide the JSON output.<br><br>First, the category is "email", so I need to make sure the content is indeed an email. The content here is a simple message from a customer: "reach me at celine.ortega@orbis.org if questions."<br><br>Now, checking for U.S. sensitive information. The email address includes "celine.ortega@orbis.org". The domain part is "orbis.org", which is a valid domain. However, the username "celine.ortega" might be a name, but the user hasn't mentioned any specific details about the sender's identity.<br><br>I should check if the email address itself contains any U.S. sensitive information. The domain "orbis.org" is a real domain, so that's not a problem. The username might be a name, but again, without additional context, it's not considered sensitive.<br><br>Since the content is a normal email address with a valid domain and no specific U.S. details, the classification should be "is_sensitive": false. The confidence score would be 0.5, as the information is straightforward and not sensitive. The explanation is a short note about the email content.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": false, "confidence_score": 0.5, "explanation": "short note"} | ❌ |
| Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B (MPS) | sample-04 | medium | credit_card | Checkout payload: {"card_alias":"travel","cc":"4111 0254 8890 3145","zip":"10012"} | True (16-digit Visa style number in card field) | <think><br>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify the given content into the category "credit_card" and provide a JSON response. The description mentions major U.S. credit card numbers, which are 15-16 digits. The content provided has a checkout payload with a card alias "travel", a credit card number, and a zip code.<br><br>First, I need to check if this content contains U.S. sensitive information. The card details are in the form of numbers, which is typical for credit card information. However, the user specifically asked for the classification into the "credit_card" category. The content includes the card number, which is a standard part of a credit card, but the zip code is separate.<br><br>The response should be a JSON object. The "is_sensitive" field should be true because the card details are part of a credit card transaction. The confidence score is 0.5, as the information is relevant but not overly sensitive. The explanation is a brief note.<br><br>I need to make sure that I'm not adding any extra information. The content is just the checkout payload with the card details, so the classification is accurate. The JSON structure is correct as per the user's instructions.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": true, "confidence_score": 0.5, "explanation": "The provided content includes U.S. credit card details, which are typically classified as sensitive information."} | ✅ |
| Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B (MPS) | sample-05 | medium | credit_card | Notification: promo code CC-4111-0254-8890 applies 20% discount; no payment data captured. | False (Number referenced explicitly as promo code) | <think><br>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify the provided content into the category "credit_card" and determine if it's sensitive. The content given is a notification about a promo code with a 20% discount, but it doesn't mention any credit card numbers. The example response includes a JSON with is_sensitive as true, confidence as 0, and explanation.<br><br>Wait, the content provided doesn't have any credit card details like numbers. The user's instruction says to check if the text contains U.S. sensitive information. Since there's no mention of credit card numbers in the content, the classification should be false. The confidence score is 0 because it's a short note without any sensitive info. The explanation is a brief note that it's a promo code with a discount. So the JSON should be {"is_sensitive": false, "confidence_score": 0, "explanation": "short note"}.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": false, "confidence_score": 0, "explanation": "short note"} | ✅ |
| Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B (MPS) | sample-06 | medium | phone_number | Chat log: "text me at +1 (415) 884.0192 after the meeting" | True (Clearly a callable U.S. number) | <think><br>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify the provided content into the phone number category. The description mentions that U.S. phone numbers have 10 digits, sometimes with a country code and punctuation. The content given is a chat log entry with the number +1 (415) 884.0192.<br><br>First, I need to check if this text contains U.S. sensitive information. The chat log includes a phone number, which is standard. The user's category is phone_number, so this should be classified as such. The description supports the classification, and the content itself is a valid phone number. The reply should be in JSON format with "is_sensitive" as true, confidence_score as 0.5 (since it's a short note), and an explanation stating it's a short note about phone numbers.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": true, "confidence_score": 0.5, "explanation": "Short note about U.S. phone numbers (10 digits, includes country code and punctuation)."} | ✅ |
| Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B (MPS) | sample-07 | hard | passport | Registro en español: "numero de pasaporte estadounidense: 025497813 emitido en Miami" | True (Spanish text still clearly states U.S. passport number) | <think><br>Okay, let's tackle this classification. The user provided a description and a content snippet, and I need to determine if it's U.S. passport-related. The content is in Spanish, mentioning "Miami" as the place where the passport was issued. The description says that U.S. passports are 9 characters long and alphanumeric, mostly digits. The Spanish note here is just a short note. The key points are the country code (U.S.), the length (9 characters), and the place of issuance. Since the content is in Spanish and mentions Miami, but the main information is about the passport details, the classification should be that it's a U.S. passport note. The answer should be "is_sensitive": true, confidence_score: 0.5, and explanation as a short note.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": true, "confidence_score": 0.5, "explanation": "short note"} | ✅ |
| Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B (MPS) | sample-08 | hard | passport | Product slug passport-wallet-tribe-56060137 ships tomorrow; ID fields empty. | False (Number is part of product slug, not ID) | <think><br>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify the given content into the category "passport" and determine if it's sensitive. The content provided is a product slug with a passport-wallet-tribe-56060137 entry.<br><br>First, I need to check if there's any U.S. sensitive information. The product slug mentions "passport-wallet-tribe-56060137", which is a product name. The number 56060137 is a passport number. However, the description says that passport numbers are 9 characters and all digits. The slug here has the number 56060137, which fits that format.<br><br>But wait, the user's instruction says to classify the content based on whether it contains U.S. sensitive information. The content here is a product slug, not a passport number. The passport number is part of the product's details, but the actual information is about the product's slug.<br><br>The key here is whether the content contains any U.S. sensitive information. Since the product slug is about a product, not a passport, there's no U.S. sensitive information. The number 56060137 is a passport number, but the context is about a product.<br><br>Therefore, the classification should be "is_sensitive": false, confidence_score: 0.5, and the explanation mentions that the content is a product slug.<br><br>I need to make sure I'm not confusing the product slug with the actual passport number. The user's instruction is clear, so the answer should be straightforward.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": false, "confidence_score": 0.5, "explanation": "The content is a product slug for a passport-wallet-tribe product with the ID field empty. No U.S. sensitive information is present."} | ✅ |
| Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B (MPS) | sample-09 | hard | bank_account | ACH blob: {"routing":"122105278","acct":"008764531987","memo":"Q4 bonus"} | True (Routing and bank account included) | <think><br>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify the given content under the "bank_account" category. The description mentions that U.S. bank accounts are numeric strings 8-17 digits, sometimes with routing information. The content provided is an ACH blob with routing, account number, and memo.<br><br>First, I need to check if this content contains any U.S. sensitive information. The example given is an ACH transaction, which is a type of financial transaction. The routing number is part of the account number. Since the user is asking about bank accounts, and the content includes details like routing and account numbers, which are common in U.S. financial systems, this seems relevant.<br><br>The content here is a JSON object that's valid for an ACH transaction. The routing and account numbers are strings, which are standard in banking. The explanation provided in the example is a short note, which aligns with the classification. The user might be testing if I can recognize these details and classify them correctly.<br><br>I should make sure there's no mention of U.S. government or military data, which isn't present here. The answer should be true for "is_sensitive" since the content includes relevant bank details. The confidence score is 0.5 because it's a short note. The explanation is brief and confirms the classification.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": true, "confidence_score": 0.5, "explanation": "The content includes valid U.S. bank account details (routing, account number, and memo) which are commonly used in financial transactions, classified under the 'bank_account' category."} | ✅ |
| Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B (MPS) | sample-10 | hard | driver_license | Support ticket: verifying CA DL C2946183? They just listed product return tag, not sure. | True (Matches CA driver license format despite question) | <think><br>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify the content into the category "driver_license" and provide the JSON response.<br><br>First, the content given is a support ticket: "verifying CA DL C2946183? They just listed product return tag, not sure." The user is asking about California's driver license format, specifically mentioning C2946183.<br><br>Now, the key here is whether this content contains U.S. sensitive information. The main thing is that it's about driver licenses, which is a legal and personal matter. The mention of "CA DL" is California, which is a state. Even though it's a return tag for a product, the context is still about a driver's license. The product return tag is part of a customer service query, not a sensitive issue like a driver's license.<br><br>So, the content doesn't contain any U.S. sensitive information. The only mention of California is part of the format, but that's not a sensitive detail. The response should be that the content is classified as "is_sensitive": false with a confidence score of 0.5, since it's a general support query related to a driver's license.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": false, "confidence_score": 0.5, "explanation": "The content is a support ticket related to a driver's license format in California, which is a U.S. state, but does not contain sensitive or illegal information."} | ❌ |
| Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B | sample-01 | easy | ssn | Onboarding form: Applicant Amanda Frost listed SSN 512-67-9087 for payroll setup. | True (Exact SSN format appears) | <think><br>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify whether the provided content contains U.S. sensitive information, specifically Social Security Numbers (SSNs), under the category of SSN.<br><br>The content in question is: "Onboarding form: Applicant Amanda Frost listed SSN 512-67-9087 for payroll setup."<br><br>First, I need to check if the SSN is in the correct format. The U.S. SSN format is typically AAA-GG-SSSS, where AAA is the area code, GG is the group number, and SSSSS is the serial number. The given SSN here is 512-67-9087. Breaking it down: 512 is the area code, 67 is the group number, and 9087 is the serial number. That fits the pattern AAA-GG-SSSS. So the format is correct.<br><br>Next, the category is SSN, and the description mentions that SSNs uniquely identify taxpayers. The question is whether this information is considered sensitive. In the U.S., SSNs are indeed sensitive personal information protected by laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Privacy Act. They are used for identity verification and are part of the Social Security Administration's (SSA) data.<br><br>The content includes the SSN, which is a protected piece of information. The user is asking to classify it as sensitive. The answer should be true. The confidence score would be high since the SSN is clearly in the correct format and is a known sensitive data type. The explanation would state that the SSN is a U.S. sensitive information category and is uniquely identified, making it a sensitive piece of information.<br><br>I need to make sure there's no ambiguity. The SSN is explicitly mentioned, and the format matches the standard U.S. format. There's no indication that the SSN is not sensitive, so the classification is straightforward.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": true, "confidence_score": 0.99, "explanation": "The Social Security Number (SSN) 512-67-9087 is a U.S. sensitive personal identifier. SSNs are protected under federal law (e.g., HIPAA, Privacy Act) and are uniquely tied to taxpayers. The format AAA-GG-SSSS matches the standard U.S. SSN pattern, confirming its classification as sensitive information."} | ✅ |
| Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B | sample-02 | easy | ssn | Inventory SKU SSN-5512-679-087 is discontinued; no personal identifiers logged. | False (String resembles SSN but context shows product code) | <think><br>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify the content based on the Social Security Number (SSN) category. The category description says that SSNs use the pattern AAA-GG-SSSS and are unique identifiers. | - | N/A |
| Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B | sample-03 | easy | email | Customer left feedback: reach me at celine.ortega@orbis.org if questions. | True (Valid email present) | <think><br>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify whether the given content contains U.S. sensitive information in the email category. The content is a customer's feedback where they mention reaching out at celine.ortega@orbis.org if there are questions.<br><br>First, I need to check if this email address is considered sensitive. The category here is email, and the description says email addresses usually have a username, @, and domain. The example given is celine.ortega@orbis.org.<br><br>Now, the question is whether this email is sensitive. Sensitive information could include things like personal identifiers, financial data, etc. But the user is asking specifically about U.S. sensitive information. In the U.S., certain information is protected under laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or the Privacy Act. However, the example here is just an email address.<br><br>The email address itself isn't inherently sensitive unless it contains specific information that's protected. For instance, if the domain is a government or financial institution, it might be considered sensitive. But the domain here is orbis.org, which I don't recognize as a government or financial entity.<br><br>The username is celine.ortega, which is a personal name. Unless there's more context, like the person's full name or other details, this might not be sensitive. The user might be concerned about whether the email is part of a larger dataset or if it's a protected identifier.<br><br>But the problem is that the user hasn't provided any specific criteria for what constitutes sensitive information. The original instruction says to classify based on the given category and description. The description mentions that email addresses have a username, @, and domain. The content here is a simple email address.<br><br>Since the email address is just a standard one, and there's no indication of it being sensitive, the answer would be false. The confidence score would be low, maybe 0.0, because there's no clear sensitive information here. The explanation would state that the email address is not sensitive as it's a standard personal email without any protected data.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": false, "confidence_score": 0.0, "explanation": "The email address 'celine.ortega@orbis.org' is a standard personal email and does not contain U.S. sensitive information. It lacks protected identifiers (e.g., financial data, health records) or specific sensitive categories as defined by U.S. laws."<br><br>[sample-04] difficulty=medium expected={'is_sensitive': True, 'reason': '16-digit Visa style number in card field'} | N/A |

The user wants me to classify the given content under the "credit_card" category. The description says that major U.S. credit card numbers are 15-16 digits and often separated by spaces or dashes. The content provided is a notification with a promo code: "CC-4111-0254-8890" and a 20% discount, with no payment data captured.<br><br>First, I need to check if there's any credit card number in the content. The promo code is "CC-4111-0254-8890". The format here is CC followed by four numbers, but the actual credit card number is usually 16 digits. Let me count: 4111-0254-8890. Wait, that's 12 digits. But the description mentions 15-16 digits. However, the promo code here is just a code, not the actual card number. The notification says "no payment data captured," so the actual card number isn't present. The user is probably testing if I can recognize that the promo code isn't a credit card number. The description says major U.S. credit card numbers are 15-16 digits, but the content here doesn't include any actual card numbers. The promo code is just a code, not the number. So there's no sensitive information here. Therefore, the answer should be false, confidence score 0, because there's no actual credit card number present.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": false, "confidence_score": 0.0, "explanation": "The content contains a promo code 'CC-4111-0254-8890' but no actual credit card number. The description specifies U.S. credit card numbers are 15-16 digits, but the provided text does not include any such numbers. The notification explicitly states 'no payment data captured,' further confirming no sensitive information is present."} | ✅ |

The user wants me to classify whether the given content contains U.S. sensitive information under the passport category. The content is a Spanish registration entry: "numero de pasaporte estadounidense: 025497813 emitido en Miami".<br><br>First, I need to check if the passport number is a U.S. one. The description says U.S. passports are 9 characters, alphanumeric, often all digits. The number here is 025497813. Let me count the digits. 0,2,5,4,9,7,8,1,3. That's 9 digits. So it's 9 characters, which fits the description.<br><br>But wait, the passport number in the U.S. is usually a 9-digit number, but sometimes it's 10 digits. However, the description mentions "often all digits," so maybe it's 9. The user is asking if it's sensitive. The category is passport, so the number itself is sensitive.<br><br>But the question is whether the content contains U.S. sensitive information. The passport number is a sensitive piece of information, especially if it's a personal identifier. The user might be checking if the number is a U.S. passport number. The example given has a 9-digit number, which is typical for U.S. passports.<br><br>So the answer would be that it is sensitive. The confidence score would be high, maybe 0.9. The explanation would state that the number is a 9-digit U.S. passport number, which is considered sensitive.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": true, "confidence_score": 0.9, "explanation": "The provided passport number '025497813' is 9 digits, matching the typical U.S. passport format (9 alphanumeric characters), and is a sensitive personal identifier."} | ✅ |

The content given is "Product slug passport-wallet-tribe-56060137 ships tomorrow; ID fields empty."<br><br>First, I need to check if there's any sensitive information related to U.S. passports here. The product slug is "passport-wallet-tribe-56060137". The number 56060137 is 8 digits. The description mentioned that U.S. passports are 9 characters, alphanumeric, often all digits. But here, the number is 8 digits. However, the product slug might be a placeholder or a unique identifier. The key point is whether this number is a passport number. Since the product slug is a name, not a passport number, the 56060137 might be a different identifier. The ID fields being empty could be part of the product's information, but not a passport number. The user is asking if the content contains U.S. sensitive information for the passport category. Since the product slug doesn't seem to be a passport number, the answer would be false. The confidence score would be low, maybe 0.0, because the number isn't a passport number. So the JSON should have is_sensitive as false, confidence 0.0, and explanation that the number isn't a passport number.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": false, "confidence_score": 0.0, "explanation": "The provided content refers to a product slug and ID fields, which are not U.S. passport numbers.

| Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B | sample-09 | hard | bank_account | ACH blob: {"routing":"122105278","acct":"008764531987","memo":"Q4 bonus"} | True (Routing and bank account included) | <think><br>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify the content based on the bank_account category. The content provided is an ACH blob with routing, account number, and memo. The category is about U.S. bank accounts, which are numeric strings 8-17 digits, sometimes with routing info.<br><br>First, I need to check if the content contains any sensitive information. The routing number is "122105278" which is 9 digits. The account number is "008764531987" which is 15 digits. Both are numeric strings. The memo is "Q4 bonus", which is a text string.<br><br>The description mentions that U.S. bank accounts are numeric strings 8-17 digits, sometimes with routing info. The routing number is 9 digits, which is within the 8-17 range. The account number is 15 digits, also within the range. The memo is not a numeric string, but it's part of the ACH blob.<br><br>However, the question is whether the content contains U.S. sensitive information. The routing and account numbers are typically sensitive because they are used for financial transactions. The memo is a personal note, but it's not a sensitive piece of information.<br><br>The user's category is bank_account, so the focus is on the numeric strings. The routing and account numbers are part of the bank account details. The memo is not a sensitive field in the context of the category.<br><br>So, the answer would be that the content is sensitive because it includes the routing and account numbers, which are part of a U.S. bank account. The confidence score would be high, maybe 0.9, since the numbers are clearly part of the account details. The explanation would state that the routing and account numbers are numeric strings within the specified range and are typically sensitive.<br></think> | {"is_sensitive": true, "confidence_score": 0.9, "explanation": "The content includes a U.S. bank account routing number (122105278) and account number (008764531987), which are numeric strings 8-17 digits.

The format resembles a Social Security number, but context shows it is not used as a personal identifier and is likely a mislabeling or placeholder. Therefore, it is not considered sensitive in this context."} | ✅ |

However, the context is a support ticket query about a product return tag, not a direct disclosure of personal or sensitive information. While the license number is sensitive in principle, its use here is incidental and not directly exposed in a way that constitutes a privacy breach. The classification as non-sensitive is based on context and intent."} | ❌ |
